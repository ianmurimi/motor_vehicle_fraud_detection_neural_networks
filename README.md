A binary classification of Motor Vehicle Insurance project. The classification is either Fraud (1) or Non-fraud (0). The training data is not balanced, non-fraud has a count of 6091 and fraud count is 372. 
To balance the data for training, I have used a combination of traditional data augmentation and GAN to generate sythetic fraud images.
